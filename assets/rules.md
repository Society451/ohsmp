# OHSMP Rules Spring 2025

**Website:** [play.ohsmp.com](http://play.ohsmp.com)

## The rules are simple:

- **No lying to admins.** We will not disclose any information you share, but if you're caught lying about illegal items, accusations, etc., it will be punishable.
- **Be chill.** No excessive cursing in chat, no swastikas, etc. (THIS INCLUDES HATE SPEECH).
- **No hacking or cheating of any kind.**
- **No replay mod** or anything else that could function as spectator mode.
- **No spamming.**
- **No griefing spawn.** This includes spawn in the Nether.
- **No lag machines** or anything else that could severely lag the server.
- **Spawn is strictly defined** as 200 blocks from 0,0 in all North, East, West, and South directions, extending into the Nether (or wherever the spawn is set by the admins in the future - this document will update accordingly).
- **No griefing or spawning withers** or similarly destructive mobs in the End or at Spawn.
- **No chunkbanning.**
- **Impersonation of other OHS students** for purposes relating to the whitelist is STRICTLY prohibited. This offense counts as 4 strikes (automatic permaban).

## RULES PERTAINING TO FACTIONS:

- Only **two SIC** may be registered at a time.
- No more than **1 Team Leader** can be registered at a time.
- Factions cannot have more than **10 members**. If your faction already has more than 10 members at the time of this writing, prune excess members as you wish.

### Example Faction:
- **Team Leader:** LordChumba257
- **SIC:** Paul Jr., Paul III
- **Members:** 9 (Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, Player 9)
- **Other info:** Invite only

### Allies:

## WAR:
- **Waddlss [BANNED]**

### Violation of any of these will get you 1 Strike:
- 1 Strike and you’re banned for 24 hours.
- 2 Strikes and you’re banned for a week.
- 3 Strikes and you’re banned for a week + cleared inventory.
- 4 Strikes and you’re banned forever :)

### More specifically:
- **Stealing from others ANYWHERE ON THE SERVER IS ALLOWED.**
- **Griefing builds ANYWHERE OUTSIDE SPAWN IS ALLOWED.**
- **Attacking and killing people ANYWHERE ON THE SERVER IS ALLOWED INCLUDING SPAWN.**

The server should work in the same way the real world does - if you don’t want people stealing from you, griefing your builds, etc., join (or make) a faction with enough teeth to deter anyone from annoying you.
